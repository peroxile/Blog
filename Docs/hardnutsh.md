# Hard Nut in shell:  Buiding Automation workflow 

Building and automating tasks can be considered critical at some point if much.... 



The math behind automating the probability of improving a job:

```bash


Let F = number of failed jobs in the period.
Let T = total jobs in period.
Failure rate = F/T 

Expressed as a percentage
(F / T) × 100

A displayed value of **25%** implies:

F / T = 0.25

- Example instantiation: if 25 jobs failed out of 100 total, or 5 out of 20, or any pair maintaining the 1:4 ratio.

Probability of “improving” the rate cannot be computed from the metric alone.  
A probability requires a defined stochastic model: distributions of job outcomes over time, independence assumptions, and historical variance.  
The screenshot provides only aggregated counts, which are insufficient to derive any predictive probability.
